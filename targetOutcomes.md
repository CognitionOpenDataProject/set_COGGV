For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section 3.1. Across participants accuracy. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Analysis of error rates (Fig. 3) revealed that the inversion effect was strongly reduced when there was no conflict between visual and actual gravity compared to the conditions were there was a conflict of gravity (t(21) = 2.72; p < 0.02; partial eta2 = 0.26).

> The inversion effects were decomposed with Student’s t-test. Analysis revealed that in the conditions with upside down bodies, participants made more errors when gravity orientation was also inverted (gravity conflict, Fig. 1b) than when visual gravity was upright (Fig. 1d) (t(21) = 3.87; p < 0.001; partial eta2 = 0.42). In contrast, we found no differences between the conditions with upright bodies (Fig. 1a and c) (t(21) = 0.35; p = 0.73; partial eta2 = 0.006).
The inversion effect was also computed on RT for conditions with gravity conflict (conditions b–a in Fig. 1) and conditions with- out gravity conflict (conditions d–c in Fig. 1). The normality of data distributions was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. No distributions differed from normality (all p > 0.05). The inversion effects were compared using Student’s t-tests. The threshold of statistical significance was set at 0.05.

> The reaction time results (Fig. 4) revealed that the inversion effect was also strongly reduced in the condition in which there was no gravity conflict compared to the conditions in which there was a gravity conflict (t(21) = 2.87; p < 0.001; partial eta2 = 0.28). Analysis revealed that in conditions with upside down bodies relative to retinal coordinates, participants were slower when gravity orientation was also inverted (gravity conflict, Fig. 1b) than when visual gravity was upright relative to retinal coordinates (Fig. 1d) (t(21) = 4.10; p < 0.001; partial eta2 = 0.45). In contrast, we found no differences between the conditions with upright bodies (Fig. 1a and c) (t(21) = 0.13; p = 0.89; partial eta2 = 0.001).
